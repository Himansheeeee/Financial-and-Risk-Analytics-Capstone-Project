# Financial-and-Risk-Analytics-Capstone-Project
In this project I have worked as an associate at an investment firm, we analyze stock portfolios  to offer investment management advice based on client’s financial  requirements.
I Have analyzed 24 stocks from top companies across diverse sectors—aviation, finance, healthcare, and technology—listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Leveraging core data analytics skills in Power BI, Python, Tableau, and EDA, I conducted an in-depth stock market analysis to identify valuable insights. The findings were then used to build customized investment portfolios tailored to the financial objectives of clients Mr. Patrick and Mr. Peter.
